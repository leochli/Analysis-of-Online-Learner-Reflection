How human construct cognitive models?Human being have models about the world so that when they perceive some objects, they could identify this object—in other words, put this object into a category and find how to deal with this object based on their past experience. For example, you are in a bus station, and when you see a vehicle which is big and have the number of 123 in it, you will know it is the bus could reach your destination and start to take out your bus card or coin to get ready for getting on the bus. But if you see a vehicle which is small and with a ‘taxi’ board, you will know it is a taxi and start to wave your arm to stop it if you want to take this taxi. Also, this model can be seen as some kind of ‘knowledge’ and it is presented as interconnected networks.So, how human construct their cognitive models? They continuously receive information from outside and adapt to it if the information not correspond to the existing model. And this kind of adaption could be divided into two kinds: assimilation and accommodation. Assimilation is adding new component without change existing schema, such as when you are waiting in a bus stop and this is the first time you come to this stop. And you see a smaller bus which only accept coins. So you will add a new category of ‘small bus’ in your model. And accommodation is reconstructing your schema. For example, when you arrive the bus station, you see a post says there is some change in the route of bus 123 and you find after the change, bus 123 will not reach your destination, so the schema will be reconstructed and bus 123 will be move from ‘bus could reach my destination’ from ‘bus could not reach my destination’. To conclude, we rely on our cognitive models to instruct our behavior, and our cognitive models are constructed by absorbing new information and making necessary adaptation.
