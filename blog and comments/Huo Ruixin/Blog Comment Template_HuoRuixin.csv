The texture and color of hair seems not related to problem solving. Maybe your point of ‘problem solving’ is more like ‘could answer people’s question’? Like ‘what color is your hair?’"

And your example explained the aspect of transmitting and receiving vividly. And your example of learning codes in the internet both elaborated how we can learn from it and the answering the question of what information means to you. The organization is really clear."
3,https://mingkwok.wordpress.com/,10/02/2017 11:11PM,Your opinion of the information's definition is pretty new to me and give me lots of inspiration. The idea that information helps us on understanding our situation give a good summary on the use of information. But I'm wondering whether there is some information that is not related to understanding situation? Just like some knowledge like information--2x2=4 or something like this.

As the part of information's meaning, in my opinion, although we are engineering student, maybe it is still necessary for us to consider the communication between human. Learning ways human communicate could help us to analyze and improve algorithms/methods in the computer world."

But in my opinion, the underlying models are different in different recommendation  systems. For example, the model we learn in class used for movie recommendation is based on the matrix of user's rating on certain movie, movie and its category. But in the example in this essay like advertisement may based on user's input and doing matching process between user's input and advertisement content. "

And as a person who is rational and have the ability of distinguishing true information and false information, what we should do is that when we receive some information, evaluating the credibility first. And the evaluation can be based serveral criteria: whether it matches our common sense, the source of information (an article in academic journal is more credible than wikipedia ) and so on. But the problem is that many people do not have the awareness of evaluating the information, they just receive and remember the information."

But in my opinion, besides information that could improve our life and harmful for our life, more information belongs to the category that it is hard to say 'good' or 'bad', it is just a kind of life style: like the fashion trend. And I believe that if it is not harmful for our life (mental and physical health), people could follow their heart to choose whether to do as information suggests."

But sometimes social media has bad effects. When people meet with friends, they do not talk with each other but play their mobile phones and when friends eats together, the first thing they do is taking photos of the food in order to post them on SNS. These occasions happen frequently in recent days and it reduced our joy in the real life in some extent"

And I totally agree that signs plays an important part in our life. In our daily life, sign is a more striking and simpler way to inform people. Words may take more space to convey the same meaning and it also has some disadvantages like, if we travel abroad and don't know their local language, this may not able to convey the information as expected."
10,https://emily3320.wordpress.com/,11/03/2017 21:53PM,"Your essay give me a clear explanation on what is the difference between UI and UX. From this , I learned that UX is is like a big concept which includes theoretical researches, data analysis and many other fields, and UI is a part in this  big concept, which mainly focus on the final graphical design. In summary, UI is the practical part of the whole UX  area."
11,https://irenetseblog.wordpress.com,11/03/2017 21:36PM,"Your point of the simpler the sign is, the better people could remember it is really interesting. And based on the result, I think that it also relates to the color of the signs. If the colors in the sign are striking and contrasting colors, it could be easier for people to remember it. For example, the sign of Burger King and 7-11 is more complex than the sign of adidas. But Burger King and 7-11's performances are better than adidas. Maybe its because the Burger King have a striking color design, but adidas is made from black and white."

Someone may think that with AI, we will have less opportunity to use our own body and it will lead to our bodies' degradation. But in my opinion, it only save efforts for us in the heavy or unnecessary activities, if you have the needs to keep your body fit, you can do exercise with scientific instruction and it will help you keep healthy."
13,https:/skyyy111.wordpress.com,11/17/2017 20:18PM,"The theory of information foraging with proper examples to explain the theory is well organized in the essay and it really helps me to have a better understanding on the information foraging theory. Also, the benefits that information foraging theory brings to us, improving time allocation, is quite interesting and understandable when it is brought up with the same scene-- creating a Facebook page. "
14,https://garychanchihang.wordpress.com/,11/17/2017 20:50PM,"I agree with your point of view that good UI should make good use of signs and icons, and your examples of Instagram and Yahoo and the comparison between them is quite convincing.  Icons and Signs could contain the meaning which may use many words to convey and it is a method which does not have language barriers and it makes signs be applied in the webpage all over the world."
15,https://ierg332.wordpress.com,11/17/2017 22:43PM,"Your example of the signs on the road gives a clear explanation on semantic information and the advantage of signs and icons-- simpler for people to understand and receive information they want to convey.  And the examples in the essay of the type of semantic information: shape and color is interesting. But this kind of semantic information can only be understand when people receive enough training. In this aspect, can we say that it also have some disadvantages?"
16,https://lckhenry.wordpress.com,11/17/2017 22:27PM,"I strongly agree with you that semantic information plays an important part in our daily life. In fact, everyone's daily life is instructed by different semantic information. Also, the method in the essay of imagining what will happen if semantic information no longer exists in our life is quite interesting to explain this statement. "
