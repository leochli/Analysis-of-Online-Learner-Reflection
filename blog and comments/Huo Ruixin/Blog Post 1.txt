What is Information and what does it mean to me (as an Engineering student)?The information is some contents that is released by the source and be transmitted by transmitter, then the receiver will obtain them and after some process (like decoding), these content will reach the destination. Moreover, these contents can help us reduce the uncertainty about some events. For example, when tutor needs to notice students about the tutorial’s location through email, the source is the tutor and the transmitter is tutor’s email server and the receiver is students’ email servers and destination is students. And email’s content (information) reduce the students’ uncertainty about what the location of tutorial is. Also, information can be many other forms. And as an Engineering student, information is not only everywhere in our daily life, but also an essential part in our study and career. In our study, we learn knowledge about information by the information provided by professors. After acquiring knowledge, we use them to analyze numerous messy information (like information in social network) to get new information which is useful for us, such as customers’ needs and preferences. Also, by these users’ feedback information, we will try to improve the way information are provided that they can be received by users. In one word, information is a thing that I will always learn from, deal with and try to optimize.
