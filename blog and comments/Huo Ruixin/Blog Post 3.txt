My friend once told me a funny story that when she first came to United States and tried to get her driving license, she did not have much knowledge about the test about what will be tested. After she passed the first part, she was led to see an examiner and the examiner opened a small book, asking her ‘What it is’ (see the picture above) and her answered ‘it is a red octagon’ and felt lucky that she knew how to say this figure in English words. But the examiner gave her a fail and she did not get the license. When she talked with her friends, she was told that it is a stop sign.From that story and lecture content about signs, I have some reflections. In lecture, we know that a sign has a meaning other than its own form. And in the story, my friend concentrated on the form of figure, but not its implicated meaning behind. But we could not simply say that what she did is wrong, instead, I would like to say that the meaning of a sign is different based on its context. The problem is that my friend not know much about what will be tested on the exam, which means she did not have a clear understanding on the context. In the context of test of driving license, this sign means a stop sign, but in a test for color blindness/ intelligence, this sign maybe just means a red octagon. So the meaning of sign is not unique and same in all context, it could change when you are in different environment—different test, different time and different location. And it needs our cognition model to learn from adaption in different context and then based on certain environment, choose which meaning should be used.
