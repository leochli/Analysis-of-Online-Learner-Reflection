I did some research in deep neural network this summer. To recognize a face, dnn takes 21 landmark points on human faces as input. After inferring thought the neural network, some subtle and unintuitive features could be extracted. Then we use classifier to analyze the attributes. It’s interesting that we actually recognize faces in almost the same way. Like this –>  __ which only consists of 2 points and a curve yet everyone could recognize it as a smiling face. I do belive learning how human perceives and understands information would help AI go further."

For most of non-engineering or non-IE major, they could barely understand how information is propagated and why information could be calculated in bits. I admire Shannon’s information theory very much coz it literally changes how the world is running.Yet I don’t agree the acceleration Iphone or IOS system is due to a faster tranfer speed of information. It’s pretty much like an improvement on CPU and GPU performance. That’s why the world also needs CSers to do great work."

But I cannot agree with you on “we will rely on computers in decision making in the future”. Actually, our brain is amazing not because it could perceive and store information, but quite the way it processes the information. Today’s deep learning and AI tech allow computers to deal with lots of conditions like playing chess, Natural Language Processing etc. Yet it’s mainly based on the composition of classification problem, that is, a “smart brain” consisting of “IF-THEN-ELSE”. I don’t see the possibility of computers really “understand” what they’re doing, unless we human understand our brains thoroughly first."

Actually, I’m information to you and you’re also information to me. Could we say that the world is encoded with information? (Sounds quite like Matrix in this way) We’re perceiving information all the time and transimitting information to the outside all the time. We reacts to outside since we process the outside information and get a response from our brain, then our nerves convey the responsive information to our muscles, vessels etc. Finally our body gives the reaction."

I do think you make a good point on that we shouldn't rely to much on such sources since they're not 100% reliable. However, on the other side, they're performing a great role in communicating and  discussing. Whenever I encounter unknow terminologies, I would turn to Wikipedia and whenever I have a bug in my program, I would look for it in the Stack Overflow. So I would say these two websites are more for study purpose. If we're going to do serious research problems, academic journals and papers are what we should rely on."

Yet today the world is still striving for this. Some of the European countries are doing an awesome job in femal rights such as Iceland and Finland while as you mentioned, there're also countless girls at the other corner of the world, suffering day and night."

I think this also explains the phenomenon that today stickers and memes are so popular! Traditionally, we're using voice, languages, words etc to convey the semantic information. Yet today the highly advancedly information techonology and social medai allow us to communicate by stickers, video clips etc. In some occasions, they're even performing better than our traditional methods and could convey a more precise meaning of what we want. For me, a ""Confuse Nick Young"" stick is always better than the sentence ""This is funny""."

Actually our 5 senses help us to perceive the outside information and ths it the first level of cognition, as you mentioned. On the one hand, the foregoing reactions may be resulted from our previous experiences. For instance, walking in the dark is not safe. Using hands to sense the environment could help avoid potential dangers. In this case, this knowledge processing is based on our control of knowledge. It's the second and the third level of cognition, which are metacognition and epistemic cognition respectively. On the other hand , such reactions could also inits from  our gene. If this is the case, the natural reactions to avoid the dangers is an unbelievable gift from our ancestors."

As we grow up, the ability to understand semantic information is quite amazing. This is also one of the major challenges that AI is facing. Us human relies on our neural system to deal with the semantic meanings while computers depend on NLP(Natural Language Processing). I do believe that with the development of deep learning, our computer would be more and more intelligent."

Apart from our daily life, such as symbols of commercial stores and icons of applications, graphical information could also make a difference in knowledge learning and sharing. For instance, when we’re preparing for a keynote presentation, it’s also better to convert the dull text and formulas into vivid symbols and figures. Of course text information has its indispensable functions in explaining things formally. If we can improve our ability of converting them into graphical information in the appropriate situations, our lives would be much easier."

Actually I do think that the three levels of information are equally important since all of them are indispensible to our modern society. Thus, I don't think it's appropriate to use the word ""evolve"" to describe the above three levels. They're independent and have some cross field. But it's hard to say some physical information evolves into semantic information or digital information. I also like your example of sharing a tree portait in the facebook. It's really vivid and comprehensible. Hope to see your more posts!"

It's a genius approach to create the ""traffic light"" with sounds in different frequency. Actually we're hearing these ""traffic lights"" everyday in Hong Kong. As we have learnt the three levels of information: digital, semantic and physical, the core idea is how can we convert the information so that those in need can perceive. For instance, we can convert graphical information into audible information to help blind people. We can convert audible information into graphical information to help deaf people. At this stage, it might cost a lot to make these translations cover every aspects of our lives. Yet with the development of AI, it's assumable that more and more intelligent devices would be deployed to help them out."

Indeed they're different from each other in many aspects. We human can deal with all kinds of informations while AI can only access the digital information and follow the fixed rules assigned by its designers. However, I don't think it is fair to say that AI is stupid. With today's development in computer vision and deep learning, AI could first get the visual information from camera and process them through their systems. It's indeed interesting that we human also first capture the visual information from our eyes and process their through our brains. They are actually quite simillar. "

Actually I’ve been using add blockers on safari and google chrome for several years. As information is so important in the commercial world, for example, if a movie would facinate 50% of the people who have viewed their trailer, then no doubtly spreading their trailers is very likely to increase their box office. The same principle applies to other commercial products. For me, in today’s advertisement market, most of the ads are “polite” and not offending, such as those in YouTube or at the side bar of a website. However, even 1% of malicious ads can destroy our user experience. That’s also the reason why I install add blockers for every browsers in my pc."
15,,17/11/2017,"Bit by bit, it's unbelievable that today machine can learn by themselves and even ""recognize"" objects. Indeed they learn in a quite different way from humanbeings (obviously we don't have any CPUs or GPUs inside our brains). But I think machines and we human actually are quite simillar in the cognitive process. Using our eyes, we get the visual information from ouside (physical or semantic), then our brain convert the information to biological information and process them in a very complex system. On the other hand, for AI, visions are captures by cameras and converted to matrixs, most of which pixels in RGB channels. After getting the visual information, either by traditional machine learning or deep learning method, the AI would process the digital information following the designed systems. Quite simillar in this way, right? But this time, we humanbeings are like the Jesus of machines."

I totally agree with you that a faster information flow would make our life easier. However, if the informations are open and shared, the security would become a crucial problem in the society. How can we prevent internet violence if personal data are disclosed? How can companies gain their competence if all the information are shared?Besides, I cannot agree with you on deploying sensors everywhere in the city. Although we can acquire countless data by doing so, the sensors might become the governing tools of the government. Imagine that government are clear about everything and everyone in the city. What if the government is not a justified one? How can we make sure that the privacies would not be stolen for bad use?As for how to turn information into data, in today's image processing, all the data would be converted into pixel matrix with RGB channels. So the computer could further process the information by doing matrix transformation on the matrices.One evidence is that autonomous driving has been realized by deep learning method. Hence the car has been able to recognize the road and do corrective moves accordingly."
