The postmen and engineers in your examples seem to have the duty to control the transmission part of information. Considering the Shannon-Weaver model of communication, it includes “information source, message, transmitter, signal, channel, noise, receiver"" Which parts do you think are the controllers really execute on? As for me, I think the controllers not only execute on transmitter, but also on channel. Besides, this concept can be extended. I mean the sender and receiver can also be controllers. Since they are also responsible for the information being sent."

Whenever we are in some environment, we can obtain information from it. And our bodies also have information, because they contain biological information of human. As for the selection part, however, I think it is not just because of importance. For example, we may hear some loud noise when workers are constructing buildings. Although it may not be important to us and it may be annoying, we can also know some information."

And you highlit some keywords using bold letters which show the emphasis. Besides, the real-life experience of your own helps to illustrate the functions of social media, from both user’s point and engineer’s point. I also agree with you that by analyzing the recommendation system of successful products, we can obtain useful information. And it helps when we design our own products."

It uses real experience to illustrate how information can reduce uncertainty. Apart from accurate information, I think cognition is also important when we perceive information. For example, the e-mail may say the location is on T.Y Hall. However, some people can get misperception when they first read the e-mail because they think “Ah, Y.C Hall, I know where to go.” Consequently, they go to the wrong place. So, in my opinion, both information and cognition are essential for us to learn."

And this “illusion” can be further explained by embodied cognition. When we perceive the surrounding environment, our bodies serve as a fundamental reference for assessing the size of other objects. That’s why the difference of estimation and baseline becomes larger when the participants embodied in the figure of a 4-year-old child. I also experienced this cognition illusion. When I visit the community that I lived in 10 years ago, I need only 10 minutes to walk through while it took 20 minutes when I was a child. The community does not change but my perception is that it becomes “smaller”. That’s the influence of embodiment cognition."

It is also true for recommendation system. It can be powerful and benefits people’s life. But it may provide fake information as well. Scientists keep finding new models that can recommend with better performance. Let me explain further using the Netflix recommendation system. When the system recommends movies for users, it’s not just doing basic matrix factorization like what we did in class. Actually, it also takes biases into account. For example, some users may give higher ratings for all movies compared with others. These biases may cause effects to the results. By adding more components into the model, the system can give more accurate recommendations."

And this can also be explained by epistemic cognition in the social dimension since it leads to collaborative knowledge construction. Social media facilitate interpersonal communication. However, if we want to construct shared knowledge more effectively, we must build a healthy social network first. This indeed needs users to behave properly to maintain a healthy network environment."

And they keep developing and updating. For example, when we were young, people used telephones to call each other. But nowadays, telephones are getting replaced by mobile phones. Besides, I also want to say that social media have new functionalities apart from connection and communication. For example, self-presentation. People using social media can build different identities which may give people different impression that they want to show. And they can control this by self-disclosure, which means that they can reveal their own information consciously."

Let me explain further about semantic information. Semantic is the study of “meaning” and semantic information carries some specific meaning using semantic content including index, sign, and symbols. But languages (words) are also semantic information. They have meanings because of semantic convention. Therefore, you can’t say that semantic information give people information more easily compared to words, since the former includes the latter."

But the premier is that people must have convention over these symbols. Let me explain this using the traffic lights as an example, we know that in most places the red light means “stop""nd the green light means “go on"" But what if one country disobeys this convention and uses the lights reversely. Then it will become dangerous for people from other places. Therefore, common convention is also important when we comprehend the semantic meanings of symbols.hhe"

And then you explain them step by step. I appreciate your structure. And I also agree with you that humans learn information from embodiment towards abstraction. But as for digital agents, such as computer, they learn from the other direction. Firstly, they receive digital information which contains abstract symbols and then they convert them into semantic information. And finally, they can study perception and cognition."

But my point is different from yours. From the lecture, we learned that digital agents study from abstraction to embodiment. My understanding is that digital agents can digest digital information more easily. And then they can learn semantic information. Perception and cognition of physical information is the hardest part. You conclude that AI is the integration of three layers, while I think AI will only process digital information at last. Take AlphaGo Zero as an example, it beat AlphaGo. It does not learn from human’s experience, however, it learns by itself. After bypassing semantic information, it performs better anyway. Maybe this suggests that human can also learn from the machine. Because digital agents are always in the most abstract part."

These buttons are actually symbols which carry semantic information. Symbols are signifiers that could mean anything, but have specific meaning only because of
conventional usage in a given culture. As for the music buttons, if we have already known the meanings, then we won’t bother to click and try. But for those people who are new to these symbols, they may not know what kind of semantic information that each symbol carries on. Only after trying for several times can they dig out the conventional usage and semantic information."

In fact, when computers are doing NLP, they actually decontextualize semantic information and then assign some values to the words so that computers can calculate and analyze mathematically.."

The system collects semantic information from customers and then converts semantic information into digital information. After semantic analysis over digital information, the system can make good recommendations for customers. Also, machine learning is now a hot topic. By learning about information from this course, we can apply our knowledge when we study further about machine learning."

Actually, numbers are semantic information because they come from language and have conventional usage. But student ID is a piece of digital information and has its digital affordance. For example, it can be input to software and map to one student. We can use this sequence of number to trace the student and check the information of that student. Therefore, semantic information is the meaning in behind and digital information can be computed."
