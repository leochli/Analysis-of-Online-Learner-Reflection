                        Introduction 

•   The information items that need to be represented  
    include:  
     ––  electric dipoleselectric dipoles, , a set of coa set of co--occurring electric fieldsoccurring electric fields with with  
        different boundaries, and equipotential lines that  
        converge and diverge from the poles and are always  
        moving perpendicular to the electric fields. 

•   Its visualization is composed of these design patterns: 
     –– the positive and negative poles (the positive and negative poles (TokenToken), the lines that ), the lines that  
        converge and diverge from these poles (Branch), the  
        arrows that show the direction of the flow of these  
        equipotential lines (Link), the two groups (Group) of  
        concentric ovals (Area) that encode the co-occurring fields  
        and bounded areas.

    Information and Representation 

•   Information visualization design is fundamentally  
    concerned with encoding information. I.e., converting  
    information from one form to another. information from one form to another.  
•   (Semantic) information is converted from an abstract form  
    in information space (e.g., concepts, statistics, facts, data)  
   to a concrete (i.e., visual with a “physical” shape) form in  
    representation space. 

                                                                                     6

          Information Space and  
           Representation Space 

•  An information space contains all kinds of data,  
   concepts, ideas, processes, models, etcconcepts, ideas, processes, models, etc.. 
    – These items can be conceptualized as having spatial  
       characteristics.  

•  Representation space is the space in which  
   information items are encoded into perceptible information items are encoded into perceptible  
   visual forms. 
    – A representation space can be reified in a physical  
       display such as a computer monitor and a mobile  
       device display. 

                                                                              7

                   Visual Marks 

•  Visual marks are the primitive  
   building blocks of visualizations  
   which can form into more complex which can form into more complex  
   representation.  
•  E.g., dots, lines, and simple shapes. 

•  A visual mark can also represents  
   an information item (e.g., a car)  
   which can be symbolic or  
   analogical. 

                                                                        8

                 Visual Structure 

•  Visual structures in the representation space are  
   composite, being made up of two or more visual  
   marks (e.g. lines and dots) according to the marks (e.g. lines and dots) according to the  
   organization of information (e.g., the structure of a  
   social network). 
•  Examples of abstract structures include coordinate  
   structures, cellular structures, hierarchical structures,  
   tabular structures, containment structures, and  
   geometric structures. 

                                                                              10

                  Visual Variables 

•  Visual variables are visual properties that can  
   meaningfully encode information in meaningfully encode information in  
   visualization representation. 
    – E.g., color, size, angle/orientation, texture, shape,  
       curvature, and motion (in dynamic displays). 

••  Some of these properties (e.g., color, spatial, Some of these properties (e.g., color, spatial,  
   size, motion) have more specific sub-features: 
    – E.g., color can vary with respect to hue,  
       saturation, and luminance. 

                                                                              11

                   Visual Variables 

•  Visual variables can be used to encode information. 
•   E.g., in addition to encoding the existence of three  
    items in the information space, different visual items in the information space, different visual  
   variables can be adjusted to encode more information  
   from the information space using: size (b); color hue  
    (c); shape (d); spatial location (e); and color saturation  
    (f). 

                                                                                    12

                    Visual Variables 

•   In the example below, a geographical map of the U.S. itself  
    encodes the spatial position (latitude and longitude (i.e.,  
    location).  
     ––  (Left) The (Left) The size variablesize variable of the visual marks (dots) can be used to of the visual marks (dots) can be used to  
        further encode the population of each areas.  
     –  (Right) The additional variable of color hue can be used to  
        encode a property of the population (e.g., has used two hues  
        to encode two possible values for a property of the areas such  
        as whether the majority of residents prefer one sport over  
        another). 

                                                                                          13

                          Visual Tasks 

•   To human users, some visual variables are more  
    effective than others in supporting effective than others in supporting visual tasks visual tasks such as such as  
    perceptual judgments and comparisonsperceptual judgments and comparisons. .  

•   Visual tasks can be roughly divided into low-level and  
    high-level tasks. 
     –  Low-level visual tasks refer to goal-driven behaviors that  
        are performed by the human visual system while looking  
        at visualizations (e.g., perceiving the comparative sizes of at visualizations (e.g., perceiving the comparative sizes of  
        two visual marks) (cognitive). 
     –  High-level visual tasks are driven by high-level goals such  
        as categorizing a set of items while solving a problem  
        (metacognitive or epistemic cognitive). 

                                                                                            14

                         Visual Tasks 
•   The type of visual variables has an effect on low-level  
    visual tasks during human visual processing.  
     –  Human users demonstrate different level of accuracy when  
        looking at visualizations with different visual variables.looking at visualizations with different visual variables. 
•   Furthermore, these effects are especially accentuated  
    when the time available to perform the tasks is very short.

       mental models, and analytical reasoning.
