 Blending of Patterns: Example 3

         encodes a genre. 
     –   The histogram sub-visualizations within the cells encode the relative  
         number of movies within the genre, and are organized using the  
         coordinate system from 1-5+ (∈CR) to encode the number of other  
         genres with which movies are shared. 
     –   Bubbles within the main circle (∈∈TK) encode the existence of shared  
         films between/among genres. 
     –   Bubbles are arranged in a specific order from small to large in a  
         clockwise fashion (clockwise fashion (∈∈LS).LS).

     –  The coordinate system for the Democrats is stacked on top of

     –  Small dots encode individual senators (∈∈TK), and links connect  
        (∈∈LK) senators to themselves at different points in time. Their  
        position on the vertical axis is based on the balance of their position on the vertical axis is based on the balance of their  
        votes with respect to the party (large dot).

    has become rare for senators to occupy the middle
