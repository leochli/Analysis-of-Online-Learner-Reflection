    humans look for information by using behavior humans look for information by using behavior  
    patterns similar to those used by other animals  
   when foraging for food. 

•  Two key concepts: 
    –– Information patch:Information patch: A A structurestructure in the environment in the environment  
       where information is present. 
    – Information scent: The stimuli produced by the  
        information patches that enable a user to assess the  
       value of the corresponding informational object.

   behavior of people interacting with information  
   e.g., online web-browsing and offline book  
   searching) were performed.  

•  Information foraging theory suggests that human  
   users users augment their information augment their information searchsearch (e.g., (e.g.,  
   time allocation and item selection heuristics)  
   through assessing the value and quality of the  
   surrounding cues.

    advertisements in both advertisements in both  
    LonelyPlanet and food blog sites.  
     –   This suggest advertisement has a  
         weak information scent for users in  
         general, despite of information  
         credibility.

    or click on the category links which  
    were located near the  
    advertisements. 
     –   This suggest that advertisements

   environment and semantics.). 

•  But digital technology decouples information
