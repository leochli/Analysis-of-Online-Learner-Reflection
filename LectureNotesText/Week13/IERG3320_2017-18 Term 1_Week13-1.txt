              Digital Environment 

•  Information and communication technology has  
   changed how we experience “changed how we experience “placeplace”. ”.  
•  E.g., the on-screen places for shopping are expected  
   more and more to be integrated with physical stores.  
    –  users begin shopping on the Web—a place without a  
       physical location—but is “placed” in a “store” to see  
       necessary information about products. 

                                                                                2

             Digital Environment 

•  Nowadays, there are also physical objects in  
   our surroundings that are digitally enabled.our surroundings that are digitally enabled. 
    – We may encounter digital information on a  
       screen alone or in the ambient digital activity in  
       our surroundings (e.g., embodiment or with  
       contextual computing). 

                                                                           3

      Architecture + Information 

•  Designers and researchers have been exploring  
   how to structure semantic information within how to structure semantic information within  
   digital systems into environmental structures 
   that would make sense to human users.

         Information Architecture 

•  Information architecture (IA) is an area in UX  
    Design Design that that is focused on making is focused on making information information  
    findable and understandable by human users.

        Information Architecture 

•  Good IA design: Information products and services  
   are perceived by people asare perceived by people as places made of places made of  
   information, and that these information  
   environments can be organized so that you can  
   find the information you need and understand it  
   once you have found it. 

•  That’s why context is so important! 

                                                                           7

              What Make Places? 

•  Place is a function of the relationship between an  
   agent and the layout of its environment. agent and the layout of its environment.  
    – A place affords meaningful actions. E.g., a workplace.  
    – We can create structures that we intend to be perceived  
       as places. 
    –  It’s through making sense of “space” that the space  
       becomes a place. 

•  From an embodied point of view, place is perceiver- 
   specific.  
    –  Places can shift in what they are to a perceiver, depending  
       on what action is happening in the moment. 

                                                                                 8

            Information and Place 

•  As human, there’s no escaping the places we make with  
    information. The semantic information we add to our  
    environment plays a powerful role in how we comprehend, environment plays a powerful role in how we comprehend,  
    experience, and inhabit places. 

•   In everyday life, humans perceive physical information and  
    semantic information as one blended environment.  
     –  (Remark: Such physical/semantic information can be further  
        “digitized” into digital information.)

                                Map 

•   IA is largely concerned with  
    both describing and both describing and  
    instantiating places; while  
   these places are made largely  
   of semantic information. 

•  A map is a semantic- 
    information artifact information artifact that helps that helps  
    us understand the  
   environment that it describes

                 Object and Place 

•  There has always been a contextual  
   relationship betweenrelationship between placeplace andand objectobject. .  
    – A building is an object; however, because of how it  
       is used, and because people can fit inside its  
       boundaries, it is usually experienced as a place.

    •  This environmental innovation takes advantage  
       of a real, contextual insightof a real, contextual insight 
        – subway passengers have to stand and wait for trains,  
           and they are often in a hurry to get to or from home.  
        – In addition, they need to remember a list of things  
          they should get at the store rattling around in their  
           heads.  

    •  Cleverly, these simulated store shelves take the  
       context of customer behavior into account,  
       bringing the store to the customer. It transforms  
       one context into being another at the same time.

Implications to Human Information

•  The semantic functions we use to design  
   information environments are no longer just information environments are no longer just  
   hyperlinks contained in screens.  
•  They can now involve any action that users might  
   take in any place they inhabit.
