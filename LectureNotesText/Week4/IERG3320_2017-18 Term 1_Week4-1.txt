          Information as Artifacts 

•  Artifacts are information objects created by human effort.  
   E.g., books, documents, user-generated contents, etc. 

•  Books as an example of physical information artifact: 
    –  The information in an author’s mind is mapped onto a coding  
       system (a written language) and the mapping is manifested by  
       some physical process such as ink carefully placed on paper.  
    –  The ink and paper artifact is then made available to others who  
       map the ink bits onto their own minds as information states. 

•  Social media enhance the generation and dissemination of  
   online information artifacts. 

                                                                               12

•  (A proven theory) Social epistemic cognition can

•  SEC can lead to collaborative knowledge

          Collaborative Knowledge  
                      Construction 

•  In online social networks, we can construct  
   knowledge together through Collaborative  
   Knowledge ConstructionKnowledge Construction 
    –  E.g., People learn from each others through Quora 
       http://www.quora.com/ 
    –  E.g., Students learn from each other through online  
       discussion. 

•  The shared goals of collaborative knowledge  
   construction amongst all members within a healthy construction amongst all members within a healthy  
   social network include: 
    – to solve the problem; 
    – the continued attempt to construct and maintain a shared  
       conception of a problem; and 
    – to individually acquire knowledge.

•  Assimilation vs. Problem-based discussions 
    –– Assimilation (passive):Assimilation (passive): Some Some online participants online participants simply simply  
        ignore ignore new information to minimize problems; they may new information to minimize problems; they may  
       also assimilate peer responses to their beliefs to minimize  
       differences arising from the discussion. 
    –  Problem-based discussions (active): Some online  
        participants, however, treat new information as  
       something that needs to be further explained and  
       discussed. 

•  The more the participants engage in problem-based  
   discussions, the more effective is the knowledge co- 
   construction in the online community.

      Collaborative Knowledge Construction 

5 levels of responses to unfamiliar information (Chan, 2001)  
•   Sub-assimilation: New information is reacted to at an apparent  
    level 
     –  E.g. Yeah, I guess [the statement] is right (no further explanation) 
••  Direct assimilation:Direct assimilation: New information is assimilated as if it were New information is assimilated as if it were  
    something already known 
     –  Well, [the statement] is basically the same as what I thought 
•   Surface-constructive: New information is comprehended, but  
    its implications for one’s beliefs are not considered 
     –  E.g. I understand [the statement] now, it means….. 
••  Implicit knowledgeImplicit knowledge--building:building: New information is treated as New information is treated as  
    something problematic that needs explaining.something problematic that needs explaining. 
     –  E.g. I am not quite understand about [the statement], would you  
        please explain more? 
•   Explicit knowledge building: New information is accumulated  
    for constructing a coherent domain understanding. 
     –  E.g. I am not quite understand about [the statement], let me try  
        explain it in this way / try thinking it in this way……                                 19
