                      Social Networks 

•   A social network can be viewed as a group of actors that are socially  
    tied to each other. 
     ––  Examples of social tie include social connections or social interactions, Examples of social tie include social connections or social interactions,  
         etc. 
•   Online social networks are social networks where the social  
    interactions are carried out online. 

•   The social network can be represented by a graph, where the nodes 
    represent the actors; the edges represent the social ties between  
    them.  

                                                                                                 2

 Online Social Networks: Examples 

•  Examples of online social networks include: 
    –– FacebookFacebook users and their “friendship”users and their “friendship” 
    – Twitter users and their follower-followee 
       relationships 
    – Members in our course blogger community and  
       their “commenting” relationships

    Online Social Networks: Examples 

•   Actors who are the most important or the most prominent are  
    usually located in strategic locations within the social network.

         Social Network Analysis 

•  A key goal of social network analysis (SNA) is the  
   identification of the most important actors identification of the most important actors in a in a  
   social network. 

•   Importance of a node within a social network  
   can be determined by 
    –– Its ability to communicate directly with other nodes;Its ability to communicate directly with other nodes; 
    – Its closeness to many other nodes; and 
    – Its indispensability to act as a communicator between  
       different part of a network, etc.

        how you comment on your classmates’ blog in order to achieve  
        collaborative knowledge building and what are the social  
        epistemic cognitive processes involved).

•   Barabasi and Albert (1999) suggested two generic  
    mechanisms for the phenomenon:mechanisms for the phenomenon: 
     – (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of  
        new vertices, and 
     – (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are  
        already well connected.
