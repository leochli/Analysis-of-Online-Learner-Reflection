•  The landscape is much an “information environment”. 
••  For us to get around in a place, there has to be For us to get around in a place, there has to be  
    information about the structure and environment that  
    we somehow understand well enough to take action. 

•   Also note the stone wall in the field. 
     –  Such structure was added by human to their environment.

         Elements in a “Context” 

•  Circumstances The setting or situational factors that  
   surround the subject. 

•  Agent The (implied) entity that is trying to understand the  
   subject. (The agent can be a person, perceiver, or non- 
   human “user”). 

•  Subject The event, statement, or idea that is in the  
   circumstances, and that is the focus of the agent’s circumstances, and that is the focus of the agent’s  
   attempted understanding.  

•  Understanding A comprehension (or effort toward  
   comprehension) of the meaning of the subject and its  
   relationship to its circumstances. 

                                                                                 7

                               Context 

•  Context isn’t just the surrounding circumstances. 
     –– It includes and interacts with the subject that is It includes and interacts with the subject that is  
        surrounded, and the agent that tries to comprehend  
        it all. 
     – As soon as something is “in a context,” it changes the  
        context.  

“Context isn’t something that describes a setting; it’s something “Context isn’t something that describes a setting; it’s something  
that people do....It is an emergent feature of the interaction,  
determined in the moment and in the doing. In other words,  
context and...activity...cannot be separated. Context...arises  
from and is sustained by the activity itself.” (Paul Dourish, 2004) 

                                                                                           9

                           Context 

•  The circumstances are not separate from the  
   agent that’s perceiving and trying to understand agent that’s perceiving and trying to understand  
   the subject. Instead, the circumstances contain  
   all these elements. 

               The agent is also part of the circumstances. 
                                                                                10 

----------------------- Page 11-----------------------

                             Context 

•   What about circumstances in which the agent is also the  
    subject? (When you are navigating within a space, such as  
    an airport, trying to understand which label applied to you an airport, trying to understand which label applied to you  
    in the overall system of labeling.) 

                       The agent is often also the subject.                           11

                          Context 

•  We’re pretty much always trying to understand who  
   and where we are in relation to our environment while and where we are in relation to our environment while  
   simultaneously needing to understand the context of a  
   lot of other things happening around us. 

•  One moment, something is the subject but at another  
   it’s just background, part of the circumstances.  

•  In addition, we’re almost never trying to take in only  
   one subject at a time; instead, we’re absorbing a  
   shifting, roiling torrent of them. 

                                                                             12

                            Context 

  An agent in the midst of multiple subjects, and complicated circumstances. 

•  A factor in all this complexity is the amount of attention we can  
    pay and the cognitive effort we have to bring to bear on our  
    environment and everything it’s made of, including ourselves. 

                                                                                    13

A Working Definition of Context

A Working Definition of Context 

•  Agent An entity that can act in the environment. Not all agents  
    perceive or act the same way. 

•   Understanding An agent’s cognitive engagement with, and making  
    sense of, its surroundings. 

•   Relationships between the elements Everything within the context  
    is made up of parts; context is all about how those parts relate to  
    one another. 

•   The agent’s environment Context is always about the entire  
    environment, because the environment is what informs the  
    meaning of anything the agent is trying to understand.  
     –  “The agent’s environment,” implies that context is a function of the  
        agent’s own first-person perception that led to its own cognition,  
        experience, and understanding. 

                                                                                     15
