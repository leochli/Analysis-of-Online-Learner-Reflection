•  Suppose Alice knows nothing about the family. 
     – She estimates p(E ) = p(E ) = p(E ) = p(E ) = 1/4.

•  Suppose Bob knows the family well. 
     – He estimates p(E ) = 1/ 8, p(E ) = 1/ 4, p(E ) = 1/ 2, and

   message “3”.message “3”. 

•  For Alice, the information content of this reply is

•  The same reply carries more information for  
    Bob than for Alice.Bob than for Alice. 
•  If we also consider the entropy of the  
    information source (i.e. the family): 

              bits 
     H = 2 for Alice               entropy will be maximum when uncertainty is maximum. 

     H < 2 for BobH < 2 for Bob 

•  So the entropy of a same source is different?!

              Information Entropy 

•  Physical entropy (in thermodynamic) is an  
   objective quantityobjective quantity.. 
    – Thermodynamics is a branch of physics concerned  
      with heat and temperature and their relation  
      to energy and work. 

•  Information entropy is a subjective quantity. 

•  Informational entropy is not defined without an  
   “observer”. 
    – Entropy as a measure of uncertainty (Shannon, 1948)

    Physical Entropy vs. Information  
                          Entropy 

 •  (Hwang, 2014) Information entropy of a  
    system is interpreted as physical entropy of a system is interpreted as physical entropy of a  
    whole composed of both the system and  
    “memories (of observers)” containing  
    information about the system.

                  What is Energy? 

•   Energy is what effects changes in nature at all  
   levels.levels. 

•   Energy can be active (kinetic) or stored  
   (potential), transformed, and measured. 

••  There There are many kinds of energy (e.g., are many kinds of energy (e.g., light, light,  
   mechanical, electromagnetic, chemical etc.),  
   each with basic properties and measures used to  
   define and study it.

                What is Energy? 

•  We understand “energy” through the quality  
   and quantity and quantity of change it effectsof change it effects.. 
    – For example, a basic measure of energy is the  
      joule, which combines mass, distance, and time  
       qualities and quantities. 

    – E.g., a joule is a one newton force that moves an  
       object one meter. 

                                                                          8

            Informational Energy 

•  Information is defined by a reduction in  
   uncertaintyuncertainty.. 
    – The change brought by informational energy is  
       reduction in uncertainty. 

••  In In fact, reduction in uncertainty is a kind of fact, reduction in uncertainty is a kind of  
   change in mental state.

•   People learn by perceiving information.

   another require some kind of energy form.

       Cognitive Load 

         •   We have mass, weight, force, and load 
             in mechanics in Physics.in mechanics in Physics. 
              –  Force is a measure of the interaction  
                 between bodies.  
              –  Load is a term frequently used in  
                engineering to mean the force exerted  
                on a surface or body.  

         •   Cognitive psychologists also define the  
            term “Cognitive Load” to indicate the  
             burden that one’s mental system bears  
             while engaged in a task.

                    Cognitive Load 

•   Cognitive load is related to the amount of information  
   that that our working our working memory can hold at one time.memory can hold at one time. 
     –  Intrinsic load refers to the true effort needed to  
        understand the content (i.e. information)  
     –  Extraneous load refers to the load that the medium or  
        delivery system puts on the receiver. 
     –  Germane load refers to the load that is necessary for  
        memory schemas construction.memory schemas construction. 

•   Effective transfer of knowledge (via the transmission  
    of information) must minimize extraneous load. 
     –  E.g., by applying strategies in information visualization. 

                                                                                     14

        although they both convey the same information.
