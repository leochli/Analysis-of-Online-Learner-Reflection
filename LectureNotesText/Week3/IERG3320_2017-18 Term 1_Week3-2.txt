      Information as Thought and  
                     Memory 

•  “Information in the head” is the set of  
   concepts and relationships active at a given  
   time interval.  

•  This condition may arise through 
   – introspection and reflection on concepts or  
      events recalled from memory; or 
   – external stimuli acquired by our perceptual  
      system. 

                                                               3

      Information as Thought and  
                     Memory 

•  Information as what we know depends on  
   our perception and our memory .  
   – Perception defines our instantaneous attention  
      and awareness of the world.  
   – Memory defines our past thought, sensations,  
      and experiences. 

•  Information in this sense is what is in our  
   memory and what our perceptual system  
   brings to thought. 

                                                             4

   Social Context of Information 

•  Example: Which card(s) you must turn over in  
   order to verify the rule below?  
   – The rule is: “If there is a vowel on one side of the  
      card, then there is an even number on the other  
      side of the card .”

    Social context of information 

•  The correct solution is A and 7 
•  Now add some social meaning: “if a person uses  
   public transportation, he must have a valid ticket.”  

                                          Person 
  Person has        Person uses                             Person 
                                         does not 
    a valid            public                               has no 
                                        use public 
     ticket        transportation                         valid ticket 
                                      transportation 

•  Introducing a social context may change the  
   mediating processes in logical reasoning. 

                                                                        6

 Human Information Processing 

•  Signals flow from the world to our brains  
   (through our senses) and only upon working  
   memory deciding whether to use the signal does  
   it become information. 

•  Information received from the external world  
   can result in the change our mental state. 

•  E.g., receiving the family’s reply to your party  
   invitation.  

                                                                  8 

----------------------- Page 9-----------------------

Human Information Processing 

               •  For example, 
                   – Light streaming through our eyes  
                     activates sensor cells in our retinas  
                     that, in turn, are propagated along  
                     nerve cells to our working memory. 
                   – Working memory activates and  
                     compares long term memory images  
                     (recognition), computes (decides)  
                     whether subsequent mental or motor  
                     action is necessary, and if so, executes  
                     action (e.g., remember, write down the  
                     number). 

                                                                     9

                 Mental Models 

•  Suppose you visit a new country in which all  
   pedestrians can walk on a red light but need to stop  
   at green light. 
    – You cannot immediately know why the traffic signals are  
       encoded in this way, but you can adapt instantaneously if  
      you do not want to get hit by the cars. 

•  We always start with what we have learned and try  
   to reconstruct our thought and knowledge on that  
   basis in order to adapt to new situations. 

                                                                         11 

----------------------- Page 12-----------------------

              Mental Models 

•  If the new information corresponds to  
   something that you have already known, no  
   adaptation is needed 

•  Else, an adaptation is needed, then it causes a  
   change in our mental models. 

•  We organize our knowledge within our mind  
   as cognitive schemas. 

                                                             12 

----------------------- Page 13-----------------------

            Cognitive Schemas 

•  Cognitive  
   psychologists  
   suggest that we  
   represent and  
   organize our  
   knowledge in mind  
   in form of  
   interconnected  
   networks of simple  
   units (e.g., a  
   semantic network).  
                               Image source: (Collins and Loftus, 1975) 

                                                                   13 

----------------------- Page 14-----------------------

            Cognitive Schemas 

•  Schemas will be changed when we learn upon  
   receiving new information. 

•  According to Jean Piaget’s theory of cognitive  
   development, we are born with certain innate  
   schemas, as we encounter things in our  
   surrounding environment, our schemas will be  
   modified. 
   – The schemas become more complex as the brain  
      matures and when we acquire new knowledge. 

                                                                 14 

----------------------- Page 15-----------------------

   Assimilation and Association 

•  Piaget further suggests that we modify our  
   cognitive schemas via two possible processes:  
   assimilation and accommodation. 

                Image source: (Dan MacIsaac, 1991) 
                                                                     15 

----------------------- Page 16-----------------------

   Assimilation and Association 

•  Assimilation happens when we encounter new  
   information that can fit into our existing  
   schema. 
    – The new concept will be appended to an existing  
      unit in the schema. 

•  Accommodation happens when we encounter  
   new information that cannot fit into our  
   existing schema.  
    – The schema will be restructured so as to include the  
      new concept. 

                                                                  16

  Three Levels of Human Cognitive  
                       Processing 

•  Three vertical levels of human cognitive processing on  
   information during open-ended problem solving  
   (Kitchener, 1983): 
    –  First Level: Cognition 
    – Second Level: Metacognition 
    – Third Level: Epistemic Cognition  knowing and  
       knowledge

  Three Levels of Human Cognitive  
                   Processing 

•  (Kitchener, 1983): 
•  Level 1: Cognition: individuals memorize,  
   read, write, and perceive media. 

•  Level 2: Metacognition: individuals monitor  
   and self-regulate their own progress when  
   they are engaged in these first-order tasks. 

•  Level 3: Epistemic Cognition: individuals  
   reflect on the limits of knowing, the certainty  
   of knowing, and criteria of knowing.

            on a ship. How old is the captain?on a ship. How old is the captain? 

•  Most adults have enough expertise to realize that  
   this problem is unsolvable, but many school children  
   didn’t realize this at all. 
    –  More than 3/4 of the children in one study attempted to  
       provide a numerical answer to the problems. 

                                                                              22

•  Let’s try this question, in which the answer is  
   a number. 

      Consider a double-decker bus. There are 10  
         passengers on the lower deck, and 15  
    passengers on the upper deck. The question is:  
               How old is the bus captain? 

                                                                 23

  Three Levels of Human Cognitive  
                     Processing 

•  In the previous example: 
    – we were engaged in cognition (the first level)  
      when we read the question;  
    – we were engaged in metacognition (the second  
      level) when we paid attention to particular part of  
      the question (e.g. the numbers); and 
    – we were engaged in epistemic cognition (the  
      highest level) when we thought about whether  
      we have enough knowledge and information to  
      answer the question, as well as whether it is  
      reasonable / logical to ask / answer the question. 

                                                                  24

                     Cognition 

•  When we come across new things, it would  
   process in cognitive stage. 
•  E.g. we read tweets from Twitter / watch a  
   video from Youtube 

                                                                 25 

----------------------- Page 26-----------------------

                 Metacognition 

•  Metacognition is sometimes defined as “cognition  
   about cognition”, or “knowing about knowing.”; e.g.: 
    – Data processing: e.g. categorization of data and  
      notes taking 
    – Checking on current progress and identification of  
      the working task 

•  Metacognition helps people to perform many  
   cognitive tasks more effectively.  

                                                                    26

            Epistemic Cognition 

•  Epistemic cognition is an essential condition  
   for solving real world open problems 
   – which are very often ill-defined and unsolved, in  
      contrast to puzzles with defined solutions. 

•  Epistemic cognition can lead to innovation and  
   new knowledge formation. 

                                                                  29

•  The 5-component Epistemic Cognition Framework (Chinn  
   et al., 2011) 
    –  Epistemic aims and values 
    –  Structure of knowledge 
    –  Source, justification, and epistemic stances 
    –  Epistemic virtues and vices 
    –  Process of achieving epistemic aims 

•  EC is driven by epistemic aims such as knowing,  
   understanding, justification, and new knowledge  
   construction 

•  Remark: EC has both individual and social dimensions.  

                                                                              30

        Epistemology (知識論) 

•  Epistemology is a central field of Philosophy. 

•  Epistemology is the philosophical study of  
   knowledge and knowing, which also referred  
  to as “theory of knowledge”. 

                    What is knowledge? 

                                                              31 

----------------------- Page 32-----------------------

   Truth, Belief, and Knowledge 

•  Truth is a relation that holds between a  
   proposition and reality. 
   – i.e. truth is the correspondence to reality 

      It is raining. 

                             Truth

----------------------- Page 33-----------------------

    Truth, Belief, and Knowledge 

•  Belief is a relation between a believer and a  
   proposition. 
    – The relation here is “holding to be true” 

•  Reality is the object of the proposition. 

                             It is raining.

----------------------- Page 34-----------------------

   Truth, Belief, and Knowledge 

•  A classical definition for knowledge isjustified  
   true belief (JTB). 
•  A subject S knows that a proposition P is true  
   if and only if: 
    – P is true  
    – S believes that P is true, and  
    – S is justified in believing that P is true  

                                                                       34 

----------------------- Page 35-----------------------

   Truth, Belief, and Knowledge 

•  JTB is a generally accepted definition of knowledge but  
   epistemologists are not all satisfy with it. 
    – The knower may simply knows by luck through justified  
       but invalid processes. 

•  A better definition of knowledge 
    –  Knowledge is true belief formulated in epistemically  
       conscientious ways. 

•  In later part of this course, we will explore how social
