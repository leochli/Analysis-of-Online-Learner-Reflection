            What is Information? 

(Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy) 
•• Information is an objective Information is an objective (mind(mind--independent) independent) entityentity. .  
   It can be generated or carried by messages (words,  
   sentences) or other products of cognizers 
   (interpreters).  
    –  Information Theory focuses primarily on conditions  
       involved in the generation and transmission of coded  
       (linguistic) messages. 

•  Remark: Information entropy, which is a quantitative  
   measure of information (i.e., the meaning conveyed  
   by a message) in terms of reductions of uncertainty, is  
   a subjective measure.   

                                                                               2

   Information as Semantic Content 

•   Semantic is the study of “meaning”. 
••  Semantic information Semantic information regards information as semantic regards information as semantic  
    content (i.e. content that conveys meaning).content (i.e. content that conveys meaning). 
•   The semantic mode of information is highly related to  
    language (written and spoken). 

                                                                                                 3

      Language and Sensemaking

      Language and Sensemaking 

•  We engage in a dialogue with ourselves about  
    the environment and our choices in it, putting the environment and our choices in it, putting  
    the mirror of language in front of us to “reflect”  
    on our actions.

     How Semantic Information  
                          Works 

•  Nouns are essentially copies of the objects that  
   people see and name in their daily living people see and name in their daily living  
   environment. 
    – Language (e.g., words) has meaning because of  
       semantic (語義) convention.  

••  To understand how To understand how semantic information semantic information  
   functions in our environment, we need to begin  
   with some basics about signs and symbols, and  
   the mechanisms of signification. 

                                                                         6

 Signs: Icons, Indexes, and Symbols 

•   In the fields of linguistics and semiotics, a sign is  
   something that can be interpreted as something that can be interpreted as having a having a  
   meaning other than its own form. 

•  While physical information has intrinsic meaning, 
    – e.g., Physical stairs are real things and can support  
       our physical actionsour physical actions 
   semantic information has a meaning other than  
   its own form.  
    – E.g., “stairs“means physical stairs, however, you  
       cannot walk up with the word “stairs”. 

                                                                                 7

           Signified and Signifiers 

•   In semiotics (the study of signs and symbols and  
   their use or interpretation), a sign has two their use or interpretation), a sign has two  
   components: 
    – Signifier: the material aspect of it, such as the image,  
        mark, sound, written word etc. 
    – Signified: mental concept of what the signifier stands  
       for, it could be a concept, object or emotion.

                                Icons 

•  The signifier in an icon has some physical  
    resemblance to its referentresemblance to its referent——it looks or it looks or  
    behaves as portrayed by the signified. 

     The standard icon for “stairs” from the AIGA “Symbol Signs” collection  
     (http://www.aiga.org/symbol-signs/).

                                Icons 

•  Iconic signifiers can be more or less realistically  
   detailed. 
    –– E.g., the two pictures below demonstrate that a E.g., the two pictures below demonstrate that a  
       detailed drawing of a tree can resemble its subject  
       down to the tiniest branch, but a simple pictograph 
       with a green triangle and a descending brown rectangle  
       also looks enough like a tree to be an effective iconic  
       signifier, depending on the level of specificity required. 

                                                                                  10

                               Indexes 

•   A sign that involves a direct temporal or spatial  
    connection between signifier and signified is working connection between signifier and signified is working  
    as anas an indexindex.. 
•   E.g. a fuel gauge directly indicates the level of fuel in  
    the tank. 
     – The letters “F” and “E” are situated spatially along a  
        continuum. The needle indicates a specific amount of  
        fuel. 

                                                                                          11

•  Symbols are signifiers that could mean anything,  
   but have specific meaning only because of but have specific meaning only because of  
   conventional usage in a given culture.  

•  We know what they mean only by experiencing  
   their use in a system of other symbols and  
   contexts.contexts. 

•  Words are a kind of symbol.

              Visual Information 

•  Graphics is also semantic information. It can  
   be used when words are not well suited. be used when words are not well suited.  

•  Visual information is especially good at  
   borrowing from the objects of the physical  
   environment to create explanations, environment to create explanations,  
   metaphors, and spatial arrangements for  
   conveying meaning. 

                                                                          13

    – E.g., Venn diagram shows the intersection of  
       mathematical sets allows otherwise disembodied  
       ideas to be visualized as if they were concrete  
       objects.

              Visual Information 

•  Sometimes, graphics are used in strictly an iconic  
   manner (e.g., used as icons for what they depict.).  

•  Some visual metaphors are for functions that have no  
   present, physical referent. 
    –  E.g., a padlock’s open or closed state represents whether  
       an administrator has unlocked settings so that he/she can  
       make changes to settings.
