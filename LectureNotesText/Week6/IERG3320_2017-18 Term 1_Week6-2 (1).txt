             Perception and Physical  
                         Information 

•  We acquire knowledge and understanding through  
   thought, experience, and our thought, experience, and our sensessenses.. 
    – Cognition bounds up in the structures of our bodies and  
       physical surroundings. 

•  Creatures directly perceive and act in the world by  
   their bodies’ ability totheir bodies’ ability to detect informationdetect information about the about the  
   structures in the physical environment. 
    – As a “body-to-environment” coupling mediated by  
       physical information.

          Perception and Physical  
                     Information 

•  When ambient energy—such as light and  
   soundsound——interacts with physical structures, it interacts with physical structures, it  
   produces perceivable information about the  
   intrinsic properties of those structures.

             Perception and Physical  
                           Information 

•   The world is full of structures that inform bodies about  
    what actions those structures afford. 
     ––  Physical information Physical information is what organisms perceive in the physical is what organisms perceive in the physical  
        environment that informs the possibilities for physical action. 

•   To perceive is to be aware of the surfaces of the  
    environment and of oneself in it. 
     –  Perception (a first level cognition) is about the agent, figuring  
        out the elements of its surroundings and understanding how  
        the agent itself is one of those elements. the agent itself is one of those elements.  

•   We still depend on the same bodies and brains that our  
    ancestors used thousands of years ago to allow us to act in  
    our environment, no matter how digitally enhanced.

 Action and the Perceptual System 

•  What we see is influenced by how we move  
   and what we touch, smell, and hear, and vice and what we touch, smell, and hear, and vice

              Information Pickup 

•  Information pickup refers to how we pick up, or  
   detect, the information in the environment  
   that our bodies use for taking action. that our bodies use for taking action.  
    – The environment specifies what our bodies can or  
       cannot do (there exists a mutual structural  
       compatibility for action between bodies and  
       environments). 

•  Most of our action is  
   calibrated on the fly by our  
   bodies, tuning themselves in  
   real time to the tasks at hand.

                      Affordance 

•  Affordances are properties of environmental  
   structures that provide opportunities for action structures that provide opportunities for action  
   to complementary organisms. 

•  “Complementary” refers to the way organisms’  
   physical abilities are complementary to (and  
   work together with) work together with) the particular affordances in the particular affordances in  
   the environment. 
    – E.g., Our eyes (and the rest of our visual system) can  
       couple with the structure of light reflected from  
       surfaces and object. 

                                                                              9 

----------------------- Page 10-----------------------

                       Affordance 

•  For example, our bodies require no explanation of  
   how stairs work, because the information our bodies how stairs work, because the information our bodies  
   need is intrinsic in the structure of the stairs. 
•  Our bodies have properties that are complementary  
   with the affordances of such physical arrangements. 

                                                                                10

                          Affordance 

•   Affordances exist in the environment whether they are  
    perceived or not.perceived or not. 
     – The affordance is a property of the object. 
     –  E.g., We might not be able to see the stairs around the  
        corner in a building, but that doesn’t mean the stairs’  
        ability to support climbing doesn’t exist.  

•   The information we need for action is actually in the  
    structures of the structures of the physical environment. physical environment.  
     –  E.g., all the information necessary is intrinsic to the shape  
        and substance of the stairs.  
     –  Prior learned experience (or knowledge) might influence  
        our usage in some way. 

                                                                                        11

                           Affordance 

•   A display is a surface that exhibits information for  
    more than just the surface itself (Gibson, 1979). 

•   E.g., on a smartphone screen, a surface with  
    writing on it has no intrinsic meaning outside of its  
    surface’s physical information; but we aren’t  
    interested in the surface so much as what we  
    interpret from the writing.  
     –  Images, words, digital interfaces—these things all  
        provide information, but the ultimately relevant  
        meaning we take away from them is not intrinsic.meaning we take away from them is not intrinsic. 

•   The knowledge one can gain from these  
    information artifacts as mediated or indirect—that  
    is, compared to direct physical information pickup,                 (Image source: ebay.com) 
    these provide information via a medium. 

                                                                                            12

                         Satisficing 

•  Satisficing is a concept that explains how we  
   conserve energy by doing whatever is just conserve energy by doing whatever is just  
   enough to meet a threshold of acceptability. 
    – It’s a blended word combining “satisfy” and “suffice.”  

•  Users Users useuse what the UX designers design.what the UX designers design. 
    – Users aren’t motivated by first understanding the  
       environment. 
    – They act based on the most obvious information  
       available and with as little concentration as possible.  

                                                                                13

                        Satisficing 

•  We see this when we observe people using  
   software: they’ll often try things out just to software: they’ll often try things out just to  
   see what happens. 
    – Just the act of looking is a physical action that  
       probes the environment for structural affordance  
       information, picking up the minimum that seems  
       to be needed to move and then appropriating the to be needed to move and then appropriating the  
       environment to their needs.

                Implication to UX 

•  Context is a function of the active engagement of  
   the user. the user.  
    – Contextual meaning of the environment is dynamic  
       and is not absolutely established. 

•  The primary aim of the UX designer is not to  
   design ways for the design ways for the informational artifact informational artifact to be to be  
   used but instead to design the artifact to be  
   clearly understood by the users, so the users can  
   recruit it into their full environmental experience  
   in whatever way they needs. 

                                                                              15

                Implication to UX 

•  The mechanics of physical life shape the way  
   we understand abstractions such as language, we understand abstractions such as language,  
   social systems, and software. 
    – When using software, users’ perception seems to  
       expect that environment to behave according to  
       the same laws we rely on in the physical world.

   •   They were required to carry out these estimations twice,  
       for three differently sized cubes (15 cm, 30 cm, 45 cm). 
        ––  The first estimates were obtained after they had entered the The first estimates were obtained after they had entered the  
            virtual environment but before embodiment in a virtual body  
            (the non-embodiment size; which is the baseline size).  
        –  After some experience of being in the virtual body, the  
            participants were required to make the estimations again (the  
            embodiment size). 
        –  Differences between the two means were obtained (denoted  
            as as dmean15dmean15, , dmean30dmean30, , dmean45dmean45).).

      and Condition A. 

   •  There was an overestimation of the sizes of  
      objects compared with a nonobjects compared with a non--embodied embodied  
      baseline. Moreover, such overestimation was  
      significantly greater for Condition C compared  
     with Condition A.
