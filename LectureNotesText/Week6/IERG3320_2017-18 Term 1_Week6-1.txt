        Perception and Cognition 

•  Perception is the core mechanisms for a body  
   to receive information from the environment.to receive information from the environment. 
    – E.g., lizards perceive (to climb surfaces to eat  
       bugs), humans perceive (to walk around). 

••  Perception and cognitionPerception and cognition change very slowly change very slowly  
   for all organisms (including humans).

               Spoken Language 

•  Spoken language has been around for a very  
   long time for our specieslong time for our species 

•  Even though particular languages can change  
   a lot over centuries, the essential  
   characteristics of spoken language change characteristics of spoken language change  
   much more slowly.

    Written/Graphical Language 

•  Written/graphical language is the way we use  
   physical objects to encode verbal language for physical objects to encode verbal language for  
   communicating beyond the present moment.  

•  Writing is also a way of encoding information,  
   which is a precursor to digital code.

     Information Organization and

•  The ability to freeze speech on a surface and  
   relate it to other frozen speech on the same relate it to other frozen speech on the same  
   surface opened up the ability to have maps,  
   diagrams, broadsides, folios, all of which  
   required organization and layout.  

•  Similarly, we can also design and organize  
   digital information for computing.

•  Depended on the invention of computer and  
   networking hardware and also digital

•  The ways in which people interact with information  
    have evolved over timehave evolved over time; some aspects are ; some aspects are  
   foundational and more stable, whereas other aspects  
   are more variable and change more quickly. 

•   Most system design begins with technology first.  

••  However, a better way is to However, a better way is to understand how the world understand how the world  
    makes sense to us in the first place—with bodies,  
   surfaces, and objects—and build the rest of our  
    understanding from that foundation.

•  This is the information an entity (e.g.,  
   animals, human) use to perceive their  
   environment for purposes of environment for purposes of taking physical taking physical  
   action.  

•   It is information that functions  
    “ecologically”—that is, in the relationship  
    between an entity and its environment. 

•   It’s about surfaces, edges, substances,  
   objects, and the ways in which those things  
   contain and relate to one another to support  
   an entity’s behaviors and even survival.

              Semantic Information 

•   This is information created for the purpose of

     –  Includes all sorts of communication such as  
         gestures, signs, graphics, speech and writing.
